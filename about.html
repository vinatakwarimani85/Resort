Laid-back rooms feature Wi-Fi, air-conditioning and flatscreen TVs. They also have floor-to-ceiling windows and balconies with views of the river. Some add hot tubs. There are also casual cottages, modest dorms with bunk beds, and a campsite with upscale tents.

A breakfast buffet is available. Other amenities include a bar, and a restaurant serving Indian and international fare, in addition to an outdoor pool with views of the countryside and the river.
